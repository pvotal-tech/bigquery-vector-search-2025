    1. Only 2 months experience in GCP Bigquery AI
    2. 120 months professional experience in GCP

- Jeffrey J Sam:

    1. Only 1 month experience in GCP Bigquery AI
    2. 8 months professional experience, 24 months academic experience
    3. Very well integrated, particularly the embedding models, vector search with the BigQuery. Only constructive feedback I have is that some of the fuunctionalities provided in the boilerplate API(eg. Vector search, embedding models) do not seem to be available when using through BigQuery.
